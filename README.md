# Combinational-Circuit-Simulator
A combinational circuit simulator. That simulates a hardware circuit.

Allows for simulation of basic And, Or, and Multiplexer Logical Gates.

The test.txt files specify a circuit desription. For example how many And gates, Or Gates, or Multiplexers, the amount of inputs they accept, and their output variables. The input.txt files then specify the inputs on a per line basis.

The results.txt files are the results of pushing a specified input file through its respective test file.
